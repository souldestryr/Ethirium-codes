This Solidity contract named error demonstrates the use of three different error handling methods: require, revert, and assert. Here's a breakdown of the contract and its functions:

State Variable:

uint i = 5;: This state variable is initialized to 5. It is used as a reference value in the functions to perform comparisons.
Functions:

checkrequire(uint y) public view returns(uint)

-This function checks if the input y is greater than or equal to i using the require statement.
If y is less than i, the transaction is reverted, and an error message "The value is less than the value of i:" is returned.
If the requirement is met, it returns the product of i and y.
checkrevert(uint y) public view returns(uint)

-This function performs a similar check using the revert statement.
If y is less than i, it explicitly reverts the transaction with the message "The value of y is less than the value of i".
If the condition is satisfied, it returns the product of i and y.
checkassert(uint y) public view returns(uint)

-This function uses the assert statement to ensure that y is greater than or equal to i.
If the condition is not met, the transaction is reverted, and it indicates a critical issue or bug.
If y is indeed greater than or equal to i, it returns the product of i and y.
